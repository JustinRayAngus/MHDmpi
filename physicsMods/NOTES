1Ddpf is working ok, but there are serveral issues

1) I'm not sure I'm treating the x=0 boundary correctly (this is where ideal current source
is located). I cannot seem to get rid of oscillations in Ez and Vx that occur there.

2) I'm not sure I'm solving for the electromagnetic fluxes correctly. I may also not be 
solving the E field in time the correct way.

3) I have issues when using TVD scheme for electric field advance. Furthermore, I'm
using max(U)+Cs as Cspeed for TVD advance of magnetic field

4) I'm not resolving light waves. I don't think I understand the relaxation scheme fully yet. I'm not sure what all time scales are ignored and what's not. 

5) Going forward, set up this problem using standard explicit scheme with diffusion operator in induction equation. This will give a baseline for what the simulations should do.
