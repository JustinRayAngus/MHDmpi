same as entropy v1, except evolving actual entropy density
Sk = N*3/2*log(Pk/N^gamma), for k=i,e
rather than "specific" entropy density
Sk = N*Pk/N^gamma, for k=i,e

Note that this is the truely conserved quantity in collisionless limit
and diamagnetic heat flux term can be included while retaining
conservative form (See Braginskii)

I also have full Stress tensor here in collisional limit
