I'm trying to make the code more modular
like BOUT++ so that one can use the same
framework to run many different physics 
problems

In order to run a physics module follow
these steps
1) cd to a physics module directory (i.e ./burgers1D)
2) "source sourceMe" (this will set environment
   variables for name of and path to physics
   module
3) "cmake ../../src" (or whatever path is to
   where CMakeLists.txt is)
4) "make" (build and link)
5) "mpiexec -np N ./mhd" run the code with N
   processors
